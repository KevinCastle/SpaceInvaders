# Space Invaders: Tribute page 

First one freecodecamp project that I remade.  I had any reason to made it about Space Invaders.
I really like videogames and a weeks ago I went to a Arcade where I saw Space Invaders Frenzy. It was crazy!
So i thought about what kind of game can be so "arcade" and still being so good and popular?
