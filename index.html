        <div id='preface' class="pixelfont">This game is one of the all-time classic video games and we can think about
            it as the first shooter game of all time and obviously the first one to introduce the fighting aliens!</div>

        <p>Space invaders was created by Taito, a small Japanese company founded in 1953. One of its first products was
            a <i>clone</i> of the famous Pong. Toshihiro Nishikado, the father of Space Invaders, was a programmer
            working on Taito.</p>

        <p>Nishikado presented an idea about a soldier who, behind some trenches, shoots at enemies that were
            approaching him. But in Taito they thought maybe it could be too violent and it'll not socially accepted
            (Just remember it was 1978 and the videogames were non violent)
            and maybe would carry problems to them. After thinking about it, he decided to change it to aliens and spaceships.
            Months later, Space Invaders was born.</p>

        <p>The mechanics couldn't be simpler. Behind green cosmic shields the player has to defeat 5 columns of 11 aliens
            approaching him faster and faster each time and evading their laser rays, and the player just has 3 lifes
            to survive. No matter if the mechanics
            are simple, it results very adictive! The player controls a spaceship in the bottom of the screen and it can only
            move right or left. A third button allow you to fire straight to the top, if it impacts against an enemy
            it'll be destroyed. The objective is destroy
            all of them before they reach you.</p>

            <p> The shields that protect the player's spaceship breaks everytime a laser collide
                it (player laser's breaks it too!), being sometimes an obstacle and giving a bit of difficulty to the game. Through
                the years
                the players made strategies to survive longer. One of this strategies
                is to delete invader's from column to column from one side to the other.</p>
